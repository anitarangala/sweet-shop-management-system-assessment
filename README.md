# Sweet Shop Management System- Incubyte Assessment

This repository is created as part of the Incubyte assessment process.

  I reviewed the Sweet Shop Management System problem statement and approached it from a software testing and quality assurance perspective.


  Focus area:
  - understanding requirements clearly
  - Identifying test scenarios and edge cases
  - Applying Test-Driven Development (TDD) concepts
  - validating authentication and inventory workflows

   This repository represents my understanding of the problem and my testing-oriented approach
